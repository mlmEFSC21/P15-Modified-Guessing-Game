# P15-Modified-Guessing-Game
Module 9 Project 2 (Modified Guess the Number Game)

Requirements
Modify the program of Project 8A to count the number of guesses the player makes. If the number is 10 or fewer, display Either you know the secret or you got lucky! If the player guesses the number in 10 tries, display Ahah! You know the secret! If the player makes more than 10 guesses, display You should be able to do better!

Why should it take no more than 10 guesses? Well, with each good guess, the player should be able to eliminate half of the numbers. Do you know why any number between 1 to 1000 can be guessed in 10 or fewer tries? (You don't need to answer this question, but hopefully you understand why).
